How did I get here? When did my love for coffee begin? 
I actually remember the times when I considered the taste of coffee to be awful. 
Then I added a lot of sugar and milk to my coffee at some point... aaand it tasted better.
It was a long time ago so I cannot recall the details but I think it was only after I have tasted specialty coffee when realized that I do no need sugar in it.
I am still working on being able to resist having milk in my cup. My love for coffee has been growing gradually for the past few year and now I am kind of coffee addict.
I don't need my coffee every day. But I need good quality coffee in my life!
I am in France now and I do not have any coffee equipment here with me so the only option is to visit cafés. And that's an activity that really makes me smile :)
